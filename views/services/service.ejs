                        treatment of patients. Medical equipment can range from simple devices like stethoscopes and
                        blood pressure monitors to more complex equipment such as MRI machines, ventilators, and

                    <h2>Vaccination</h2>
                    <p>Vaccination is a process of administering vaccines to individuals in order to protect them from a
                        particular disease. Vaccines stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies that provide
                        immunity against specific diseases, and this helps to prevent the spread of diseases in
                        populations.</p>

                        and intended use. Branded medicines, on the other hand, are developed and marketed by
                        pharmaceutical companies and have unique names, packaging, and formulations.</p>

                        their optimal performance and longevity. Maintenance activities can include regular cleaning,
